# Windows "Fast Startup" crap

So Windows doesn't shut down, when you shut down. It uses some kind of franken-hibernate solution, to make the next power-on boot faster.

A restart on the other hand actually completely shuts down the computer, before booting againg.

(Some kind of MS logic i guess...)

Anyway, if you have problems with you're computer when it is first powered on, and an immediate restart fixes the issue, chances are fast startup is the problem.

Disable it by:
1. Going to "Power Options" (chose you're favorite route to it...)
1. Select "Choose what the power buttons do"
1. On this screen you see "Turn on fast startup (recommended)" (I don't recommended it!!!) under "Shutdown settings"
1. Click "Change settings that are currently unavailable" further up the screen, to enable the checkboxes
1. And disable that sucker!
