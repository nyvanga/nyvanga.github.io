- Effective vs. efficient!
- Hold a meeting only when necessary.
- Clearly define the purpose and objective of the meeting.
- Carefully select only those individuals who should attend.
- Create and share your meeting agenda with them.

During the meeting, be inclusive, and assign the next action steps to be taken after the meeting.
