## Scrum isn't going to improve performance

- Not immediately at least.
- Scrum is **not** designed to be the most efficient way of working.
- It is designed to be able to make changes, before a lot of wasted work has been done.
- So it is better at changing focus, with the added cost of maybe having less throughput.
- A lot of businesses misinterprets Scrum as a way to save development costs.

## Scrum isn't daily status meetings

- It was never part of Scrum that people daily should list what they have been doing.
- The original "daily Scrum" was to discuss progress towards the sprint goals, not specifically a status. Many things could be done, and a status is one of them.

## Scrum does not talk about "Velocity"

- Maybe it originated from extreme programming, but it is not from Scrum.

## Scrum does not contain story-points or Fibonacci numbers.

- Scrum does not proscribe any particular method to estimate. Whatever works for the team.
- Some suggests that exponential estimates work better than absolute estimates.
- Using more than very few choices gives the illusion of precision.
- Also it is up to the team to decide what to try and get done in a sprint, and thus it does not really require an estimate.
- Some points out that estimation has no value at all, and we need to [stop doing it](https://youtu.be/QVBlnCTu9Ms).

## PO cannot assign work to a sprint

- The developers discusses with the PO what needs to be done, and based on that chooses what is brought into the sprint.
- If developers are told what to do, and when to do it, they burn out and stop caring about the product and the business.
- The point of agile and Scrum is to "be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely".

## The backlog should not contain tasks

- Scrum separates the what from the how.
- Therefore the backlog should only ever contain what. Or Product backlog items (PBI's)
- A task is created for a sprint, during sprint-planning by the developers.

## Scrum does not contain burn-down charts.

- While burn-down charts can be a useful tool, it is not part of Scrum.
- Burn-down charts can have the downside of focusing to much on estimates, and short-term optimisations, rather than the longer goals of the business.

## Scrum masters are not for status reporting

- If they were, they would be called project managers.
- "Working software is the primary measure of progress"
- So at the demo everyone can see the progress, and status reporting becomes irrelevant.
